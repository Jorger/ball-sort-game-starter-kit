Welcome to the course **[Ball Sort Puzzle Using ReactJS Step-by-Step](https://www.udemy.com/course/ball-sort-puzzle-using-reactjs-step-by-step/)**

This repository contains the starter code used to build the Ball Sort Puzzle game with ReactJS — a fun and challenging logic game where players sort colored balls into tubes.

In this version, you'll find the initial setup and structure to get you started: project configuration, basic components, and container setup.

## 🧩 How the game works:

The player taps on a tube to select the top ball and then taps another tube to move it, following specific rules:

* Only one ball can move at a time.
* Balls can only be placed on top of the same color or into an empty tube.
* The goal is to sort all the colors correctly into separate tubes.

## 💡 How this relates to the course:

In the full Udemy course, you’ll learn how to build this game step by step using modern ReactJS practices. You’ll create components like balls and tubes, manage game state, implement user interactions, animate movements, detect level completion, and even turn your project into a Progressive Web App (PWA).

This repo contains only the starter setup — the full logic and features are built throughout the course.
