![scree-curso-ball-sort](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/add1cd2b-d8ed-4af9-b478-dcb3a7e6083c)

Welcome to the Ball Sort Puzzle project!

This repository contains the starter code used to build the Ball Sort Puzzle game with ReactJS â€” a fun and challenging logic game where players sort colored balls into tubes.

In this version, you'll find the initial setup and structure to get you started: project configuration, basic components, and container setup.

## ðŸ§© How the game works:

The player taps on a tube to select the top ball and then taps another tube to move it, following specific rules:

* Only one ball can move at a time.
* Balls can only be placed on top of the same color or into an empty tube.
* The goal is to sort all the colors correctly into separate tubes.

## ðŸ’¡ How this relates to the course:

In the full Udemy course, youâ€™ll learn how to build this game step by step using modern ReactJS practices. Youâ€™ll create components like balls and tubes, manage game state, implement user interactions, animate movements, detect level completion, and even turn your project into a Progressive Web App (PWA).

This repo contains only the starter setup â€” the full logic and features are built throughout the course.
